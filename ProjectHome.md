> jEDE is a Java-based open source Entity Development Environment that allows a software developer to work with enterprises entity bean using simple web user interface, eliminating the need to write entity code , entity data access code that developers usually need to write.
It gives developers an automated mechanism for accessing & storing the data in the database and working with the results .

It  provides the mechanism for:
  * Performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
  * Easily managing "1 to 1", "1 to many", and "many to many" relationships.
  * Ability to have inheritance relationships between entities.

It enables developers to work with enterprises entity bean , without having to concern themselves with the underlying entity code, entity data access code , database tables and columns where this data is stored.
With the jEDE , developers can work at a higher level of abstraction when they deal with data, and can create and maintain data-oriented applications with less code than in traditional applications.
